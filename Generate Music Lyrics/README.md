# TFlearn
TFlearn is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of Tensorflow. It was designed to provide a higher-level API to TensorFlow in order to facilitate and speed-up experimentations, while remaining fully transparent and compatible with it.

# LSTM
Long short-term memory(LSTM) is type of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) which uses special units in addition to standard units. LSTM is used instead of RNN because RNN have feedback loops in the recurrent layer which help in 'memory', but it also causes the gradient of the loss function decays exponentially with time(often called as vanishing gradient problem). LSTM are designed to avoid this problems.

# Generate English Music Lyrics
Music lyrics dataset is downloaded from kaggle(link is provided). The dataset is in csv format and therefore some modifications are needed.

*Link : https://www.kaggle.com/rakannimer/billboard-lyrics*

# Usage
1. Download the dataset from the link given
2. Delete all other columns in the csv file except for the **lyrics** column
3. Change the file directories in the code accordingly.

# Incomplete
I am not able to train the model but because lack of computing power, therefore result cannot be showed.
